# Blur
Blur is a basic photo editing app which allows you to apply several filters to an image. 
This filters include grayscale, sepia, invert, and blur.
You can also change the image contrast and brightness, and all three color channels. 
You can take a picture or upload an existing picture, by pressing the upload image or take photo buttons.
If you would like to get a feel for the filters with a sample image before editing your own files, click the Blur logo. 
This will redirect you to the photoedit page and allow you to edit the logo image. 
Click the arrow in the select filter dropdown menu to select an image filter, and drag the slider to set the filter intensity. 
When you are done, click save to save to the camera roll, or restore to undo the changes.
